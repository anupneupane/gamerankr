%h1 About
%p
  GameRankr lets you easily record which games you own, want to own, have beaten, liked, etc.
  It also lets you record reviews, an see friends and community reviews.
%p  
  GameRankr was created because all other game sites
  don't do what I want.  It's built completely by a gamer for other gamers.
  If you want to create a wishlist for Christmas or your birthday, it's easy!
  Trying to tell the people you care about what to buy you for presents can be tough
  ("what was the name of that video game you wanted again honey?"  "Geez mom, its
  so easy! Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots  for PlayStation 3").
  They don't know what you're talking about.  If you could easily organize your
  wishlist in the same place, then you make it easier for everyone to be on the same page.
%p
  Don't let strangers tell you what you should play.  At GameRankr, there are no
  professional reviews.  You can see reviews from people you know, who's opinions
  matter.
